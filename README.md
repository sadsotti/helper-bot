## **🔧 Creating the Discord Bot**

### **1️⃣ Create the app in the Developer Portal**
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications 
2. Click “New Application” 
3. Give the bot a name → Helper Bot 
4. Confirm

---

### **2️⃣ Create the bot**
1. Go to **Bot** in the menu on the left  
2. Click **“Add Bot”**  
3. Confirm with *Yes, do it!*  
4. (Optional) Set icon and name

---

### **3️⃣ Copy the token**
In **Bot → Token**:
1. Click **Reset Token**  
2. Copy the key  
3. Put it in your `.env`:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

⚠️ Never share your token.

---

### **4️⃣ Enable Privileged Gateway Intents**
Still in **Bot**:
- ✔ Message Content Intent  
- ✔ (Optional) Presence Intent  
- ✔ (Optional) Server Members Intent  

Save.

---

### **5️⃣ Invite the bot to the server**
Go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**

**Scopes:**
- `bot`
- `applications.commands`

**Bot Permissions:**
- `Read Messages`
- `Send Messages`
- `Use Slash Commands`

Copy the generated link → open it → select your server → **Authorize**.

The bot will now appear in the server (offline until you run the script).

---

## **🔐 Configuration**

Create a `.env` file:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Never upload `.env` to GitHub.

---

## **🔑 Getting the OpenAI API Key**

To use AI in the bot, you need an **API key OpenAI**.  
OpenAI is **not free**: you need active credits, but **just a few euros are enough for thousands of requests**, especially when using inexpensive models like `gpt-4o-mini`.

### How to get it:

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com 
2. Log in 
3. Go to **User → API Keys**  
4. Click **Create new secret key**  
5. Copy the key  
6. Insert it into your `.env`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
```

⚠️ **Never share it**  
⚠️ If it goes online → **regenerate it immediately**

---

## **🚀 Starting the bot**

```bash
python main.py
```

Expected output:

```
Bot active as: Helper Bot 🐱
```

---

## **💬 How to use**

### **1. Automatic AI interaction**
The bot replies to messages ending with:

```
*
```

Example:

```
Why is Python giving me an error on a list?*
```

### **2. Slash command**
```
/ping
```

Response:

```
Pong! 🏓
```

---

## **🧠 How the bot knows you're talking to it**

The bot checks the end of the message:

```python
if message.content.endswith("*"):
```

So it replies **only** when you want it to.

---

## **☁️ Deploy on Railway**

### 1️⃣ Upload the project to GitHub  
Make sure your `.gitignore` is configured:

```
.env
__pycache__/
venv/
```

### 2️⃣ Go to Railway → New Project → Deploy from GitHub

### 3️⃣ Set the environment variables:
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### 4️⃣ Startup command:
```
python main.py
```

Railway will automatically start the bot.
